Follow these steps to get FeeSavvy up and running on your local machine for development and testing.
Prerequisites
 * Android Studio: Ensure you have the latest version installed.
 * Java Development Kit (JDK): Required for Java development in Android Studio.
 * Firebase Project: You'll need a Firebase project set up with the Realtime Database enabled and the necessary SDK configurations (e.g., google-services.json).
Installation
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Chaithanya-Neeluri/feesavvy.git # Assuming this is your repo URL
cd feesavvy

 * Open in Android Studio:
   * Open Android Studio and select File > Open.
   * Navigate to the cloned feesavvy directory and click Open.
 * Configure Firebase:
   * In your Firebase project console, download the google-services.json file.
   * Place this file into the app/ directory of your Android Studio project.
 * Sync Project with Gradle Files:
   * Android Studio will likely prompt you to sync the project. If not, click File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.
Running the Application
 * Connect an Android Device or AVD:
   * Connect your physical Android device with USB debugging enabled, or create and launch an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using Android Studio's AVD Manager.
 * Run the App:
   * Click the Run button (green triangle) in the Android Studio toolbar, or go to Run > Run 'app'.
